	\maketitle
	This proposal describes a world edit plugin largely based on features originally intended in WorldEditArt, along with
	some new ideas.
	\section{Plugin mechanism}
		\subsection{Builder sessions}
			Users of this plugin should be managed in "builder sessions" with individual access information. Builder
			sessions can be created in three modes, namely:
			\paragraph{Implicit Mode}
				Players with a certain permission will start a builder session upon joining a game. The session's permission
				and location will be synchronized with the player.
			\paragraph{Explicit Mode}
				Players with a certain permission will start a builder session upon typing a command. The session's
				permission and location will be synchronized with the player, and can be closed with a command. The command
				may be locked with a private password (similar to the \texttt{sudo} Linux command) or global password
				(similar to the \texttt{su} Linux command) for additional protection.
			\paragraph{Minion Mode}
				Command senders with a certain permission (especially non-in-game senders like console) can create minion
				builder sessions upon typing a command. The session's permission and location will be controlled by the
				command sender.
